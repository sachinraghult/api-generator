Slide 3 – AI Evolution to Agentic AI

Content:

Rule-based Systems → Early AI: followed predefined logic

Machine Learning → Models trained on datasets, improved predictions

Generative AI → Models like GPT create human-like responses

Agentic AI → AI that can reason, plan, and act autonomously using tools & APIs


Speaker Notes:

> This evolution shows how we went from simple rule-following bots to AI that can independently decide what to do, and how to do it.




---

Slide 4 – Before vs After MCP

Content (Two-column table):

Before MCP	After MCP

AI relied only on static knowledge	AI can fetch live domain-specific data
Hard to integrate with secure enterprise APIs	Standard protocol for secure API access
One-off, disconnected tool calls	Multi-step, structured workflows
Limited context retention	Seamless contextual conversations


Speaker Notes:

> MCP bridges the gap between AI’s reasoning ability and enterprise-grade secure system access.




---

Slide 5 – Problem Statement

Content:

Developers face friction in accessing secure banking data for testing/analysis

Switching between coding environment & multiple banking APIs is inefficient

Risk of misinterpretation of raw API data by humans

No standardized AI integration path to banking systems


Speaker Notes:

> Our challenge is to streamline and secure the process of getting useful banking data directly within the developer’s environment.




---

Slide 6 – Project Objective

Enable natural language banking queries inside GitHub Copilot

Integrate DevX Agent as the host environment for MCP Client

Use GPT-4o for reasoning and domain-specific context

Securely connect to Bank MCP Server for account, loan, and transaction data



---

Slide 7 – MCP Bank Client-Server Architecture

(Insert the professional architecture diagram we created earlier)


---

Slide 8 – Workflow / Sequence Diagram

(Insert the professional UML sequence diagram we finalized)


---

Slide 9 – Technical Deep Dive

DevX Agent → orchestrates GPT-4o + MCP Client

MCP Client → sends structured requests to MCP Server

Bank MCP Server → returns raw banking data securely

GPT-4o → processes and formats for human readability

Security → authenticated and encrypted communication



---

Slide 10 – Live Demo

Title: Real-time Interaction with Bank MCP Server via DevX Agent in GitHub Copilot

Show:

1. Natural language query in Copilot


2. DevX Agent interpreting & calling MCP Client


3. Bank MCP Server response → GPT-4o formatting


4. Final answer inside Copilot



Highlight speed, accuracy, and context-awareness



---

Slide 11 – Benefits

Faster development – no context switching

Higher security – MCP-enforced data access rules

Scalable – works across multiple banking domains

Smarter AI responses – live data + reasoning



---

Slide 12 – Future Scope

Add write operations with approvals

Multi-agent orchestration

Expand to cross-domain MCP servers (compliance, payments)

Context retention for continuous conversations

Real-time streaming transaction data



---

Slide 13 – Conclusion

AI has evolved into Agentic AI, enabling autonomous, goal-driven operations

MCP makes AI enterprise-ready with secure, structured API access

Our POC proves that this model can work seamlessly for banking use cases

Next step: Scale beyond the POC into production-grade integrations

Slide 14 – Q&A

Title: Thank You – Questions?
Footer: Wells Fargo Internal | [Your Name]

I can now compile this into a single PowerPoint with:

Wells Fargo color palette (deep red & gold)

Our diagrams embedded

Professional icons (user, agent, GPT, bank server)

Minimal, clean layout with consistent typography


Do you want me to now prepare that PPT with this exact content and the diagrams we already have?
That way it will be presentation-ready in one go.

















Alright — I’ll rewrite AI Evolution so it’s crisper, more engaging, and forward-looking, and I’ll make Problem Statement less like a “pain points” list and more like a visionary statement showing how Agentic AI + MCP is transformative.

Slide 3 – AI Evolution to Agentic AI (Revised)

Title: From Rule-based Bots to Autonomous Agentic AI

Timeline Style (4 Stages):

1. Rule-Based Automation – Followed strict “if-then” rules, no adaptability.


2. Machine Learning – Learned patterns from data, still limited to predefined tasks.


3. Generative AI – Produced human-like text, images, and code; creative but passive.


4. Agentic AI (Today) – Understands goals, plans multi-step actions, and uses tools like MCP to interact with real-world systems securely and autonomously.



Key takeaway line at the bottom:

> Agentic AI is not just answering questions—it’s getting things done with secure, live system access.




---

Slide 5 – Problem Statement (Reframed as Visionary)

Title: The Opportunity with Agentic AI + MCP

Content:

In the banking world, data is valuable but trapped behind secure systems.

Traditional AI can explain concepts, but cannot take direct, secure action on enterprise systems.

MCP changes the game: a standardized, secure bridge between AI and enterprise APIs.

With Agentic AI + MCP, we can:

Give AI the ability to plan and execute banking workflows end-to-end

Maintain security, compliance, and governance

Unlock real-time insights directly inside developer and business tools


This is the future of AI in banking — autonomous, safe, and deeply integrated into core systems.


Key takeaway line at the bottom:

> We’re moving from “AI as an assistant” to “AI as a trusted, secure co-worker.”

If you want, I can also make this AI Evolution slide more visual—like a horizontal progression with small icons (gear for rule-based, graph for ML, magic wand for GenAI, rocket for Agentic AI).

Do you want me to go ahead and prepare both updated slides in that clean visual Wells Fargo–themed style so they’re ready to drop into the deck?
