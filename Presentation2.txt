Slide 1 – Title Slide

Title:
Agentic AI – MCP Bank Client-Server POC
Subtitle: Leveraging DevX Agent, GitHub Copilot, and GPT-4o for Intelligent Banking Workflows
Footer: Wells Fargo Internal | [Your Name] | Software Engineer

Speaker Notes:

> Welcome everyone. Today, I’ll walk you through our Proof of Concept on Agentic AI integrated with MCP client-server architecture, designed for banking workflows.
We’ll see how GitHub Copilot, DevX Agent, and GPT-4o interact with a bank server to answer user queries.

Slide 2 – Agenda

Introduction to MCP & Agentic AI

Project Objective & Overview

Architecture of MCP Bank Client-Server POC

Workflow & Sequence Diagram

Technical Deep Dive

Benefits & Potential Impact

Future Scope

Q&A


Speaker Notes:

> This will be our roadmap today. We’ll start with foundational concepts like MCP and Agentic AI before going deeper into the architecture, the actual workflow, and where we can take this in the future.

Slide 3 – What is MCP?

Content:

Model Context Protocol (MCP): Standardized way to connect AI models with external tools & data sources

Allows AI to fetch, process, and return relevant information in real time

Works as an interface layer between the AI model and the target system

MCP Client ↔ MCP Server → Communication via structured messages (JSON / HTTP / WebSocket)


Speaker Notes:

> MCP is like a translator between AI models and real-world systems. It ensures that when our AI needs bank data, it knows exactly how to request it and interpret the response.




---

Slide 4 – What is Agentic AI?

Content:

Agentic AI = AI that can reason, plan, and act autonomously

Not just responding to prompts — it decides the next step to achieve a goal

Can chain multiple tool calls & queries to solve complex tasks

In our POC: Agentic AI acts through DevX Agent integrated with GitHub Copilot


Speaker Notes:

> In our case, Agentic AI isn’t just answering static questions. It decides the best path to retrieve and format the right banking data, making it a truly interactive assistant.




---

Slide 5 – Project Objective

Content:

Enable natural language banking queries inside GitHub Copilot

Integrate DevX Agent as the host environment for MCP Client

Use GPT-4o for reasoning and understanding banking domain context

Securely connect to Bank MCP Server to fetch customer, account, loan, and transaction data


Speaker Notes:

> The goal was to make banking data easily accessible to developers without leaving their coding environment, using a safe and structured communication channel.




---

Slide 6 – MCP Bank Client-Server Architecture

Diagram: (Use the architecture diagram we created earlier with User → DevX Agent → MCP Client → Bank MCP Server)

Speaker Notes:

> Here’s the architecture.

The User prompts inside GitHub Copilot.

DevX Agent is the host, embedding the MCP Client.

The MCP Client connects securely to the Bank MCP Server, which has domain-specific APIs.

The Server responds with structured data, which GPT-4o formats into a human-friendly response.

Slide 7 – Workflow / Sequence Diagram

Diagram: (Use the professional UML sequence diagram we finalized)

Speaker Notes:

> The sequence goes like this:

1. User sends a natural language query.


2. DevX Agent (with GPT-4o) interprets the query.


3. MCP Client formulates a request to Bank MCP Server.


4. Bank MCP Server processes and responds with raw data.


5. GPT-4o refines and formats the answer.


6. Final output is shown to the user in Copilot.






---

Slide 8 – Technical Deep Dive

Content:

DevX Agent = Internal orchestration layer

MCP Client = Manages structured communication

Bank MCP Server = Exposes data endpoints for banking operations

GPT-4o = Large language model for reasoning, context understanding, and response generation

Security: Authentication between client and server, data isolation


Speaker Notes:

> Technically, this is a combination of orchestration logic, protocol compliance, and secure API integration — all powered by a highly capable LLM.




---

Slide 9 – Benefits

Seamless developer experience inside GitHub Copilot

Faster access to banking data during development/testing

Strong security boundaries via MCP

Scalable — can extend to more domains, tools, and APIs

Reduces manual API exploration — AI handles it


Speaker Notes:

> This improves productivity and security while making banking workflows more intuitive for technical teams.




---

Slide 10 – Future Scope

Add write operations with approval workflows

Integrate multi-agent orchestration for complex queries

Expand to cross-domain MCP servers (e.g., payments, compliance)

Enhance context retention for continuous conversations

Incorporate real-time streaming data for transactions


Speaker Notes:

> The architecture we’ve built is a foundation. Future expansions can include multi-agent setups, additional APIs, and even real-time data feeds.

Slide 11 – Closing / Q&A

Title: Thank You – Questions?
Footer: Wells Fargo Internal | [Your Name]

Speaker Notes:

> That’s the overview of our Agentic AI MCP Bank Client-Server POC.
Let’s open the floor for questions.
