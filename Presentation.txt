Got it — you want me to create a full, professional presentation deck that flows logically from start to finish, covering:

Agenda

Introduction to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Agentic AI (how it works, why it matters)

POC Overview (with your architecture and sequence diagrams)

Detailed Flow Explanation

Future Scope

Conclusion


Here’s how I’ll structure it for a professional audience:


---

Slide 1 – Title Slide

Title:
"Leveraging MCP and Agentic AI for Banking Automation"

Subtitle:
"A Proof of Concept for Secure and Intelligent Financial Queries"

Visual: Professional abstract tech/banking theme background.


---

Slide 2 – Agenda

1. Introduction & Context


2. MCP Overview


3. Agentic AI Fundamentals


4. POC Architecture & Sequence Flow


5. Benefits & Key Outcomes


6. Future Scope


7. Conclusion & Q&A




---

Slide 3 – Introduction & Context

The rise of AI-driven agents in enterprise systems.

Challenges in secure banking data retrieval:

Accuracy

Compliance

Real-time insights


Purpose of this POC:

Demonstrate secure, intelligent, and contextual access to bank data using MCP & Agentic AI.




---

Slide 4 – What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

Definition: A standard protocol enabling LLMs to interface with external systems securely and consistently.

Key Features:

Context awareness

Modular design (client-server separation)

Structured data exchange


Why MCP here?

Ensures scalable, maintainable, and secure AI integration with the banking server.




---

Slide 5 – What is Agentic AI?

Definition: AI that can autonomously plan, reason, and execute tasks through tool usage & decision-making.

Core Capabilities:

Natural language understanding

Contextual reasoning

Autonomous tool invocation


Role in POC:

Acts as DevX Agent embedded in GitHub Copilot powered by GPT-4.

Interprets user requests, triggers MCP client, and formats responses.




---

Slide 6 – POC Architecture

(Include the final polished architecture diagram we created with User, DevX Agent, MCP Client, Bank Server, proper icons)

Flow Summary:

User → DevX Agent → MCP Client → Bank Server → Response formatting → User.




---

Slide 7 – Sequence Diagram

(Include the corrected professional sequence diagram)

Detailed steps:

1. User enters prompt


2. DevX Agent interprets request


3. MCP Client queries relevant bank module


4. Bank server returns structured data


5. Agent formats and delivers result to user





---

Slide 8 – Benefits of the POC

For Banks:

Secure AI-assisted data retrieval

Reduced manual query effort


For Developers:

Standardized integration

Faster prototyping with MCP


For Customers:

Faster, more accurate answers




---

Slide 9 – Future Scope

Expand to Multi-Bank Systems

Integrate Advanced Risk Analysis Models

Support for Voice Assistants

Integration with Compliance Monitoring

On-premise Deployment for Enhanced Security



---

Slide 10 – Conclusion

This POC demonstrates the power of combining MCP with Agentic AI for secure and intelligent banking operations.

Establishes a foundation for scalable AI-driven enterprise integrations.



---

Slide 11 – Q&A

"Questions?"

Professional, clean slide with minimal design clutter.



---

If you want, I can now generate the entire slide deck in a clean, modern, presentation-ready format with our diagrams embedded so you can use it immediately.

Do you want me to prepare the full PowerPoint/PDF version next?
